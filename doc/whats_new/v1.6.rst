Version 1.6.0
=============

**In Development**

Support for Array API
---------------------

Additional estimators and functions have been updated to include support for all
`Array API <https://data-apis.org/array-api/latest/>`_ compliant inputs.

See :ref:`array_api` for more details.

**Functions:**

- :func:`sklearn.metrics.mean_tweedie_deviance` now supports Array API compatible
  inputs.
  :pr:`28106` by :user:`Thomas Li <lithomas1>`;
- :func:`sklearn.metrics.mean_absolute_error` :pr:`27736` by :user:`Edoardo Abati <EdAbati>`;
- :func:`sklearn.metrics.pairwise.cosine_similarity` :pr:`29014` by :user:`Edoardo Abati <EdAbati>`.


**Classes:**

- :class:`preprocessing.LabelEncoder` now supports Array API compatible inputs.
  :pr:`27381` by :user:`Omar Salman <OmarManzoor>`.

Metadata Routing
----------------

The following models now support metadata routing in one or more of their
methods. Refer to the :ref:`Metadata Routing User Guide <metadata_routing>` for
more details.

- |Feature| :func:`model_selection.learning_curve` now supports metadata routing for the
  `fit` method of its estimator and for its underlying CV splitter and scorer.
  :pr:`28975` by :user:`Stefanie Senger <StefanieSenger>`.

- |Feature| :class:`ensemble.StackingClassifier` and
  :class:`ensemble.StackingRegressor` now support metadata routing and pass
  ``**fit_params`` to the underlying estimators via their `fit` methods.
  :pr:`28701` by :user:`Stefanie Senger <StefanieSenger>`.

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123455 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

:mod:`sklearn.base`
...................

- |Enhancement| Added a function :func:`base.is_clusterer` which determines
  whether a given estimator is of category clusterer.
  :pr:`28936` by :user:`Christian Veenhuis <ChVeen>`.
  
:mod:`sklearn.metrics`
......................

- |Enhancement| :func:`sklearn.metrics.check_scoring` now accepts `raise_exc` to specify
  whether to raise an exception if a subset of the scorers in multimetric scoring fails
  or to return an error code. :pr:`28992` by :user:`Stefanie Senger <StefanieSenger>`.

Thanks to everyone who has contributed to the maintenance and improvement of
the project since version 1.5, including:

TODO: update at the time of the release.
