Put the changes in their relevant module.


Changed models
--------------

The following estimators and functions, when fit with the same data and
parameters, may produce different models from the previous version. This often
occurs due to changes in the modelling logic (bug fixes or enhancements), or in
random sampling procedures.

- models come here

Details are listed in the changelog below.

(While we are trying to better inform users by providing this information, we
cannot assure that this list is complete.)

Changelog
---------

..
    Entries should be grouped by module (in alphabetic order) and prefixed with
    one of the labels: |MajorFeature|, |Feature|, |Efficiency|, |Enhancement|,
    |Fix| or |API| (see whats_new.rst for descriptions).
    Entries should be ordered by those labels (e.g. |Fix| after |Efficiency|).
    Changes not specific to a module should be listed under *Multiple Modules*
    or *Miscellaneous*.
    Entries should end with:
    :pr:`123456` by :user:`Joe Bloggs <joeongithub>`.
    where 123456 is the *pull request* number, not the issue number.

:mod:`sklearn.cluster`
......................

- |Enhancement| :class:`cluster.AgglomerativeClustering` has a faster and more
  more memory efficient implementation of single linkage clustering.
  :pr:`11514` by :user:`Leland McInnes <lmcinnes>`.

:mod:`sklearn.datasets`
.......................

- |Enhancement| Functions :func:`datasets.make_circles` and
  :func:`datasets.make_moons` now accept two-element tuple.
  :pr:`15707` by :user:`Maciej J Mikulski <mjmikulski>`.

:mod:`sklearn.feature_extraction`
.................................

- |Efficiency| :class:`feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer` now sorts
  features after pruning them by document frequency. This improves performances
  for datasets with large vocabularies combined with ``min_df`` or ``max_df``.
  :pr:`15834` by :user:`Santiago M. Mola <smola>`.

:mod:`sklearn.linear_model`
...........................

- |Fix| Fixed a bug where if a `sample_weight` parameter was passed to the fit
  method of :class:`linear_model.RANSACRegressor`, it would not be passed to
  the wrapped `base_estimator` during the fitting of the final model.
  :pr:`15573` by :user:`Jeremy Alexandre <J-A16>`.

- |Efficiency| :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV` and
  :class:`linear_model.RidgeClassifierCV` now does not allocate a
  potentially large array to store dual coefficients for all hyperparameters
  during its `fit`, nor an array to store all error or LOO predictions unless
  `store_cv_values` is `True`.
  :pr:`15652` by :user:`Jérôme Dockès <jeromedockes>`.

- |Fix| add `best_score_` attribute to :class:`linear_model.RidgeCV` and
  :class:`linear_model.RidgeClassifierCV`.
  :pr:`15653` by :user:`Jérôme Dockès <jeromedockes>`.

:mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`
............................

- |Efficiency| :class:`preprocessing.OneHotEncoder` is now faster at
  transforming. :pr:`15762` by `Thomas Fan`_.

:mod:`sklearn.tree`
...................

- |Fix| :func:`tree.plot_tree` `rotate` parameter was unused and has been
  deprecated.
  :pr:`15806` by :user:`Chiara Marmo <cmarmo>`.
